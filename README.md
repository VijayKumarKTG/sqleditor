## Performance Optimization

Let's start with the setup.

1. First of all, clone this project. 
   > `git clone https://github.com/VijayKumarKTG/newsletter.git`

2. Move into the **newsletter** directory and install all the dependencies for the server.
   > `cd newsletter && npm install`

3. After that, you need to go another step into the **client** directory and install all the dependencies for the client.
   > `cd client && npm install`

4. You are done with installing the dependencies. Now, we need to build the client to use in the backend.
   > `npm run build`

5. And the final step is to start the server.
   > `cd .. && npm start`
